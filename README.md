This program is written in JavaScript and allows the user to generate a random song title. 

## Codecademy Project
I wrote this program as a project that was recommended by Codecademy in my back-end engineering course.

The functionality is:
- Create an object with three properties; each property value is an array containing 7 values.
- Create a number randomizer to align with the amount of values in each array.
- Create functionality that concatenates the randomized parts of a song title
